Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
Been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
'Cause what's confusing you is just the
Nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades, for the gods they made
I shouted out "who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, oh yeah

Hope you guessed my name, ah yeah
But what's puzzling you is just the

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, ah yeah
But what's puzzling you is just the
