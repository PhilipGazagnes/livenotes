Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place another time
Touching many hearts along the way
Hoping that I'll never have to say
It's just an illusion

Follow your emotions anywhere
Is it really magic in the air?
Never let your feelings get you down
Open up your eyes and look around
It's just an illusion

COULD IT BE THAT / it's just an illusion
PUTTING ME BACK / in all this confusion?

PUTTING ME BACK / in all this confusion?
COULD IT BE THAT / it's just an illusion
Nooooow?

Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams I turn you on
