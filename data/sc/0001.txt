Couplet
--
Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

Refrain
--
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

Couplet
--
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, paid my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land, whoo!

Refrain
--
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Solo

***Solo***

Refrain
--
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway

Refrain
--
Yeah, highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell

Outro
--
And I'm going down
All the way
Whoa!
