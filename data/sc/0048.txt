I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he must a been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah me
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'

I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come an' take your time an' dance with me

He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
That don't matter, he said
'Cause it's all the same
Said "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
An' next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me singin'
