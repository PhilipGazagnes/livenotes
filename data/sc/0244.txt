Hello, hello
Are you in there, child?
Leave that party dress
And your suicidal smile
Hello, hello
I've come to see it done
The stripes across your face
And the battles that he's won
Don't tell me to hide
I've run from living all my life

Refrain
$3

I'm setting me free
Blood, sweat, and tears
I've been so desperate all these years
Now I'm taking my bones
And leaving your ring
This house made of glass
Is shattering
I'm setting me free

Hello, hello
I hear the sirens roar
Coming round the bend
Like a thousand times before
Hello, hello
Don't you give up the fight
Like a beat-down dog
Who's forgotten how to bite
Don't tell me it's wrong
I've only come to be your friend

Refrain

I'm setting me free
Blood, sweat, and tears
I've been so desperate all these years
Don't tell me I'm blind
It's you who won't see
The woman I am
The fighter in me
I'm setting me free
