***Intro***

Couplet
$1

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause
I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

Refrain
$2
--
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whisky
Can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

Refrain

--
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
