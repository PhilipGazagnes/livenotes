Intro

Couplet
--
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes
And make it go away
How long?

Break
--
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?

Refrain
--
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

Couplet
--
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Refrain
--
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

Theme

Couplet
--
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Refrain
--
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

Break
--
How long?
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?

Refrain
--
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight, tonight

Solo

***Solo***

Refrain
--
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

Theme

Couplet
--
And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
the real battle just begun
to claim the victory Jesus won

Refrain
--
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
