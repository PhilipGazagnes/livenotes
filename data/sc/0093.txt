Intro
--
Help! I need somebody
Help! not just anybody
Help! you know I need someone
Help!

Couplet
--
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone and I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors

Refrain
--
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Couplet
--
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But ev'ry now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Refrain
--
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
