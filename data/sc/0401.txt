You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
And dust yourself off
And back in the saddle 
You're on the frontline
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We're getting closer
This isnt over
The pressure is on
You feel it
But you've got it all
Believe it
When you fall get up
Oh oh
And if you fall get up
Eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa
Cuz this is Africa

People are raising
Their Expectations 
Go on and feed them
This is your moment
No hesitations
Today's your day
I feel it
You paved the way
Believe it
When you fall get up
Oh oh
And if you fall get up
Eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
