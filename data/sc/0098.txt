Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

Couplet

For five long years
I thought you were my man

You got me where you want me
I ain't nothin' but your fool
Ya treated me mean
Oh you treated me cruel

Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

Every chain, has got a weak link
I might be weak yeah
But I'll give you strength
Oh, hey

Break (ooh ooh)

You told me to leave you alone
My father said, "Come on home"
My doctor said, "Take it easy"
Oh but your lovin' is much too strong
I'm added to your

Refrain

Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

One of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until the day
I'm gonna take all I can take, oh hey

Refrain

Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools
