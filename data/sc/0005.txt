I don't want to lose you, this good thing
That I got 'cause if I do
I will surely
Surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock...

I'm not superstitious about ya
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnin', baby
You know I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock...

'Cause we're this lovin' touch
He sees to it
That I get enough
Fell his touch all over
You know it means so much
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock, knock...
