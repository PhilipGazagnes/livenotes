I don't want to lose you, this good thing
That I got 'cause if I do
I will surely
Surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock...

But I can't take no chance

You know I'm in a trance

The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock...

'Cause we're this lovin' touch
He sees to it

Fell his touch all over

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock, knock...
