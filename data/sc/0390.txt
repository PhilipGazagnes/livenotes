They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

I ain't got seventy days

That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
