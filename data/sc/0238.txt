You keep sayin' you've got somethin' for me
Somethin' you call love but confess
You've been a'messin' where you shouldn't 've been a'messin'
And now someone else is getting all your best

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

And you keep losing when you oughta not bet
You keep samin' when you oughta be a'changin'

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burnt (ha)
