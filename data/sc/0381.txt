I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em, hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I got

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face (she's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face (she's got me like nobody)

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And, baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun (fun)
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I got

I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin', I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous
