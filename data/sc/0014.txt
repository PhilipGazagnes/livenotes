I remember when a we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown

Along the way, yeah!
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I seh. Yeah!

I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah!
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,

And so I've got to push on through.
Oh, while I'm gone,
