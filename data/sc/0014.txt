In a government yard in Trenchtown
Oba - obaserving the 'ypocrites - yeah!

Along the way, yeah!
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I seh. Yeah!

In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah!
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,

Of which I'll share with you, yeah!
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through.
Oh, while I'm gone,
