$1
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time

$2
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

$3
Can you help me, occupy my brain?
Oh yeah

$4
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

$5
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

$6
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
