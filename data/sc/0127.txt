If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
Make it last forever, friendship never ends

Oh, what do you think about that ? Now you know how I feel
Say, you can handle my love, are you for real
I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try
If you really bug me then I'll say goodbye

So, here's a story from A to Z
You wanna get with me, you gotta listen carefully
We got Em in the place who likes it in your face
You got G like MC who likes it on a Easy V
Doesn't come for free, she's a real lady
And as for me, ha you'll see
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around

Slam, slam, slam, slam
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around

Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and zigazig ah
