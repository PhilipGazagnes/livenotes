Spy on me baby use satellite
Infrared to see me move through the night
Aim gonna fire shoot me right
I'm gonna like the way you fight
Now you found the secret code I use
To wash away my lonely blues
So I can't deny or lie cause you're
The only one to make me fly

No don't get me wrong ain't gonna do you no harm (no)
This bomb's for lovin' and you can shoot it far

And yes, I must react to claims of those
Who say that you are not all that.
