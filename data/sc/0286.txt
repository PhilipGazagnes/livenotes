Go on and close the curtains
'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me, and a bottle of wine
Gonna hold you tonight, uh, yeah
Well, we know I'm going away
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
Let's delay our misery

Refrain

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away, oh, it's true
It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darlin', please, don't start to cry
'Cause, girl, you know I've got to go, oh
And, Lord, I wish it wasn't so

And fight the break of dawn

Come tomorrow
