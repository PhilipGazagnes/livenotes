The daylight's fading slowly
But time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you only
The slightest touch and I feel weak
I can not lie
From you, I can not hide
And I'm losing the will to try
Can't hide it (can't hide it)
Can't fight it (can't fight it)

Refrain

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on
Yeah

And if there's no tomorrow
And all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you
You're all the love I need somehow
It's like a dream
Although I'm not asleep
And I never want to wake up
Don't lose it (don't lose it)
Don't leave it (don't leave it)

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on
Yeah, yeah
