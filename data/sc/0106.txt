Couplet
--
Well someone told me yesterday
That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just don't care
You look as if you're going somewhere
But I just can't convince myself
I couldn't live with no one else
And I can only play that part
And sit and nurse my broken heart

Refrain
--
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
...

Couplet
--
Now no one's knocked upon my door
For a thousand years or more
All made up and nowhere to go
Welcome to this one man show
Just take a seat they're always free
No surprise, no mystery
In this theater that I call my soul
I always play the starring role

Refrain

So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
...

So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
