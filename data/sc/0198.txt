Couplet
--
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Refrain
--
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand stand by me, stand by me

Couplet
--
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Refrain
--
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand stand by me, stand by me, ooh...
Ooh... Yeah...
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh stand by me
I won't cry, I won't cry
Stand by me
