I pulled into Nashville, Tennessee,
But you wouldn't even come around to see me
And since you're headin' up to Carolina,
You know I'm gonna be right there behind ya

Refrain

'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I love to feel that warm southern rain,
Just to hear it fall is the sweetest sounding thing
And to see it fall on your simple country dress
It's like heaven to me I must confess

Refrain

'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I've been hangin' 'round you for days,
But when I lean in you just turn your head away
Oh no, you didn't mean that
She said I love the way you think, but I hate the way you act
