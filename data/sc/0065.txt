Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

'Cause I'm just a girl, little ol' me
Well don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh, I've had it up to here!

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh, I've had it up to here!

Oh I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb make me worry some
Oh I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison
Oh, I've had it up to!
Oh, I've had it up to!!
Oh, I've had it up to here
